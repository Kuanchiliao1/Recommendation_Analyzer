# Recommendation_Analyzer

Description: 
Do you get more recommendations than you possibly have time for? Have friends that recommend you a constant stream of content that you have no time to watch/read/listen even though you want to? Perhaps you even have a recommendations list somewhere sitting around and collecting dust. 

The Recommendation Analyzer will help you with getting to the top priority items by applying our proprietary algorithm to all your recs.

Now, instead of telling your friends that you'll "get to it" when they disappointedly ask you why you never follow their recs, you can confidently tell them that your life is at the mercy of an algorithm and there's nothing you can do. 

See how much better that sounds?
